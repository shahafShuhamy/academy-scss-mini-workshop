   ## Practice:
- Make a html page, include css file for it.
The html should have a h1.
- Create a div with the class of “first”, add an ordered list, 
Each list item should have a border of 2px solid + color of your choice.    
The list item can have additional class called “text-color-<color>” and it will change the color of the text according to the name (support 3 of your choice).
- Create another div with the class of “second”, add an ordered list, 
each list item can have a text color of 3 of your choice and the background color can be changed if the text color is dark:
Light background color for dark text and dark background color for light text.
- Create 3 boxes(divs) at the bottom of the page - they all should be the same width and height.
When the boxes are moved to “first” or “second” their color should be different.
 (use nesting).
